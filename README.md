# Football-Data-Analysis-Project
This project analyzes football player and team performance using real match data. It includes data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and visualizations to identify key insights and trends in football performance.


Football Data Analysis 🔍⚽

This project focuses on analyzing football match data to understand player and team performance using statistical methods and Python-based data analysis.

📌 Project Overview

The analysis is divided into structured phases:

🔹 Phase 1 – Data Loading & Cleaning

Imported multiple football datasets.

Handled missing values, corrected data types, and performed necessary preprocessing.

Merged datasets to create a clean, consistent dataset ready for analysis.

🔹 Phase 2 – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Explored key performance metrics such as:

Goals scored

Goals conceded

Match outcomes

Team-level performance indicators

Used visualizations to understand patterns and trends in match data.

🔹 CLT Application – Goals Distribution

Applied the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) to goal-related metrics to observe:

Sampling distributions

Normality behavior as sample size increases

🔹 Probability Analysis

Performed probability-based analysis to estimate:

Likelihood of scoring events

Win/loss probabilities

Performance-based probabilities using statistical techniques
